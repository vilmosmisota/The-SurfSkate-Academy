            Since I was a child and all my adolescence, skateboarding was my
            passion. My twin brother and I spent all day on a skateboard and the
            fact that we were twins, and that we were both very good, made us
            more competitive which helped us go far.We both became recognized
            skaters with sponsors like VANS, magazine appearances, and lots of
            good competition results. From a very young age I was always a bit
            obsessed with observing my own technique and that of others. I
            realized that I had talent but if I really wanted to go far.

            In addition to spending many hours practicing with my skateboard, I
            had to be able to understand when I made mistakes in my technique,
            and at the same time know how to understand biomechanics in order to
            correct them. I developed a great ability to observe and understand
            how to achieve the movements. This observation skill became a habit
            and became part of my daily life both with the sport and with
            myself. My interest in body language became part of my profession as
            a lifeguard. During my almost 20 years of profession on the beaches
            of the Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean, knowing how to observe
            people's body language helped me to be able to identify vulnerable
            swimmers long before the water reached their knees. All of this I
            have also applied to surfing from day one.

            I have been very interested in the surfskate training format for
            several years and I have verified that the results are immediate.
            Scotland has very good waves but there is a lack of consistency and
            the cold weather could often make us stay at home. Surfskate
            training courses are ideal for all skill levels of surfers but
            without a doubt the benefit for Scottish surfers is even greater!
