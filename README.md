# The SurfSkate Academy

This is a **full-packaged**  project that was done to a client who offers on land surf training in Edinburgh/Scotland.

**full-packaged:** Web-developent, Web-Design, Logo-Design, Strategy, Photography.


## Technologies

#### Web-development:

- Gatsby v3
- GraphQL
- Condentful CMS

#### Design:

- Figma
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator



## Case study

After a short brief of the desired website from the client I started to work on the layout in **Figma**.  Then we did the photography to get the visual content ready for the design. Following a long period of experimenting with the design elements and logo, we settled on the final(ish) look. 

I decided to use **Gatsby** as a framework as the **SEO** is really important for the business, also having loads of photos on the website, I wanted to apply the new **Gatsby Image Plugin** to get the best look and performance.
In order for easy add, update and delete functionality for the client to manipulate dates and availabilities I used **Contentful CMS** and used **GraphQL** queries to manage data. In the end, I deployed the project in **Netlify** with a custom domain and webhook to auto-deployment in case of data changes in Contentful.

#### Future Improvements:

Build a server for form submissions or migrate the CMS to Strapi, depends on the client's budget.
